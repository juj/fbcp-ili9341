// On FreePlayTech GBA devices, a part of the screen is hidden by the bezels, since the GBA has a 2.8" screen surface area, but a 3.2" display is enclosed inside the case.
// The hidden area is placed under the left edge of the display horizontally, and under top and bottom edges of the display vertically, so reduce those out from the drawable area.
// Effective display area is then 320-18=302 pixels horizontally, and 202 pixels vertically (in landscape direction).

// The meaning of top/left/right/bottom here should be interpreted as the display being oriented in its native direction (which is portrait mode for ILI9341, 240x320 direction).
