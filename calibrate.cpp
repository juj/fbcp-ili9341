 *
 *   This file contains functions that implement calculations 
 *    necessary to obtain calibration factors for a touch screen
 *    that suffers from multiple distortion effects: namely, 
 *    translation, scaling and rotation.
 *
 *   The following set of equations represent a valid display 
 *    point given a corresponding set of touch screen points:
 *
 *
 *                                              /-     -\
 *              /-    -\     /-            -\   |       |
 *              |      |     |              |   |   Xs  |
 *              |  Xd  |     | A    B    C  |   |       |

 *                                              \-     -/
 *
 * 
 *    where:
 *
 *           (Xd,Yd) represents the desired display point 
 *                    coordinates,
 *
 *           (Xs,Ys) represents the available touch screen
 *                    coordinates, and the matrix
 *
 *           /-   -\
 *           |A,B,C|
 *           |D,E,F| represents the factors used to translate
 *           \-   -/  the available touch screen point values
 *                    into the corresponding display 
 *                    coordinates.
 *
 *
 *    Note that for practical considerations, the utilitities 
 *     within this file do not use the matrix coefficients as
 *     defined above, but instead use the following 
 *     equivalents, since floating point math is not used:
 *
 *            A = An/Divider 
 *            B = Bn/Divider 
 *            C = Cn/Divider 
 *            D = Dn/Divider 
 *            E = En/Divider 
 *            F = Fn/Divider 
 *
 *
 *
 *    The functions provided within this file are:
 *
 *          setCalibrationMatrix() - calculates the set of factors
 *                                    in the above equation, given
 *                                    three sets of test points.
 *               getDisplayPoint() - returns the actual display
 *                                    coordinates, given a set of
 *                                    touch screen coordinates.
 * translateRawScreenCoordinates() - helper function to transform
 *                                    raw screen points into values
 *                                    scaled to the desired display
 *                                    resolution.

 *     Function: setCalibrationMatrix()
 *
 *  Description: Calling this function with valid input data
 *                in the display and screen input arguments 
 *                causes the calibration factors between the
 *                screen and display points to be calculated,
 *                and the output argument - matrixPtr - to be 
 *                populated.
 *
 *               This function needs to be called only when new
 *                calibration factors are desired.
 *               
 *  
 *  Argument(s): displayPtr (input) - Pointer to an array of three 
 *                                     sample, reference points.
 *               screenPtr (input) - Pointer to the array of touch 
 *                                    screen points corresponding 
 *                                    to the reference display points.
 *               matrixPtr (output) - Pointer to the calibration 
 *                                     matrix computed for the set 
 *                                     of points being provided.
 *
 *
 *  From the article text, recall that the matrix coefficients are
 *   resolved to be the following:
 *
 *
 *      Divider =  (Xs0 - Xs2)*(Ys1 - Ys2) - (Xs1 - Xs2)*(Ys0 - Ys2)
 *

 *            D = ---------------------------------------------------
 *                                   Divider
 *
 *
 *                 (Xs0 - Xs2)*(Yd1 - Yd2) - (Yd0 - Yd2)*(Xs1 - Xs2)
 *            E = ---------------------------------------------------

 *                             Ys1*(Xs0*Yd2 - Xs2*Yd0) + 
 *                                           Ys2*(Xs1*Yd0 - Xs0*Yd1)
 *            F = ---------------------------------------------------
 *                                   Divider
 *
 *
 *       Return: OK - the calibration matrix was correctly 
 *                     calculated and its value is in the 
 *                     output argument.
 *               NOT_OK - an error was detected and the 
 *                         function failed to return a valid
 *                         set of matrix values.
 *                        The only time this sample code returns
 *                        NOT_OK is when Divider == 0
 *
 *
 *
 *                 NOTE!    NOTE!    NOTE!
 *
 *  setCalibrationMatrix() and getDisplayPoint() will do fine
 *  for you as they are, provided that your digitizer         
 *  resolution does not exceed 10 bits (1024 values).  Higher
 *  resolutions may cause the integer operations to overflow
 *  and return incorrect values.  If you wish to use these   
 *  functions with digitizer resolutions of 12 bits (4096    
 *  values) you will either have to a) use 64-bit signed     
 *  integer variables and math, or b) judiciously modify the 
 *  operations to scale results by a factor of 2 or even 4.
